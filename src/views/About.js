            I&apos;m a creative who&apos;s fallen in love with web development.
            Previously, I designed personalized artwork for customers, drawing
            inspiration from a charming and lively style similar to
            illustrations found in storybooks. Now, in my role as a developer, I
            strive to infuse this same cheerful and inviting aesthetic into my
            creations for web and mobile applications. I also appreciate an
            uncluttered and polished design. My aim is to develop apps that
            convey a distinct message, while also entertaining and providing a
            memorable experience for users. Combining my tech knowledge with my
            love for art has been a fun experience so far in my journey. ðŸ’›

            <strong>Interests</strong> (besides coding): adventure/puzzle games,
            vintage book illustrations, concept art, Agatha Christie(-esque)
            books, cute animals
